     1. The tree is ordered: for every node Red((key1,datum1), left, right) or
        Black ((key1,datum1), left, right), every key in left is less than
        key1 and every key in right is greater than key1.

     2. The children of a red node are black (color invariant).

     3. Every path from the root to a leaf has the same number of
        black nodes, called the black height of the tree.

               one of its children might be red.
     and dict is a re-balanced red/black tree (satisfying all invariants)
     and same black height n.
